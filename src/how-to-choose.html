              Selecting the right tie can elevate your entire look. Hereâ€™s how
              to choose the perfect tie to complement your suit.

              <h2>Consider the Occasion</h2>

              <p>
                <span>Formal Events:</span>
                Opt for silk ties in solid colors or subtle patterns. Classic
                shades like black, navy, and burgundy are ideal.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span>Casual Settings:</span>
                Feel free to experiment with bolder patterns and colors. Knitted
                ties and cotton blends can add a casual touch.
              </p>

              <h2>Match the Suit and Shirt</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span>Color Coordination:</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Complementary Colors: Choose a tie that complements your suit
                  and shirt. For a blue suit and white shirt, a burgundy or dark
                  red tie works well.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Contrasting Colors: For a more striking look, choose
                  contrasting colors. A light gray suit with a purple tie can
                  make a bold statement.
                </li>
              </ul>

                  <span> Patterns:</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Solid Suits: Pair with patterned ties like stripes, checks, or
                  paisleys.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Patterned Suits: Stick with solid or minimally patterned ties
                  to avoid clashing.
                </li>

              <h2>Tie Width and Length</h2>

              <p>
                <span>Width:</span>
                Match the width of your tie to the width of your suit lapels.
                Slim lapels pair best with slim ties, while wider lapels suit
                broader ties.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span> Length:</span> The tip of your tie should just reach your
                belt buckle for the perfect length.
